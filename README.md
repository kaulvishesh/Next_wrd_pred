# Next Word Predictor

## Overview
The **Next Word Predictor** is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the next word in a given text sequence. By training on a dataset of detailed narratives, it demonstrates how AI can analyze and generate coherent language patterns.

## Features
- Processes text using TensorFlow and Keras for robust tokenization and modeling.
- Adapts to different datasets, allowing flexibility in application.
- Generates contextually accurate predictions for creative or analytical tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used is a custom collection of lore narratives, featuring descriptions of characters and storylines. This provides a rich source of linguistic patterns for the model to learn from.

## How It Works
1. **Preprocessing**: Text is broken into tokens (individual words or characters) to form a structured input.
2. **Training the Model**: The core architecture uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units. This helps the model understand relationships between words over time. The setup also includes embedding layers for word representation and dense layers for generating predictions.
3. **Making Predictions**: After training, the model predicts the next word based on a given input sequence, ensuring the output aligns with the input's context.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or newer
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Install dependencies with:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaulvishesh/next-word-predictor.git
## Results
The model predicts the next word for any input text. For instance, feeding it part of a sentence from the lore dataset will generate the next logical word based on its training.
